                  <h2>Yemeni Food Crisis</h2>
                  <p>
                  A catastrophic humanitarian crisis is currently affecting the African continent. According to a June report, 14.1 million people in Yemen are what's known as "food insecure," including 7 million who are severely food insecure. In some areas of the country, 70% of the population struggle to feed themselves. The World Food Programme said it needs more than $257 million to give food assistance
                  </p>
                  <p> Our program aims to prevent malnutrition and treat around 700,000 children under the age of 5, pregnant women and nursing mothers.
                  It battles acute malnutrition, also known as wasting, we carry out our work through local partners in 2,200 health centers in 14 areas across Yemen.
                  Yemen had one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the world before the current conflict, according to the WFP.
